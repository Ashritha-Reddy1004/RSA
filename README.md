Implement RSA algorithm for encryption and decryption of messages using Go language.


Add a CLI command to genrate public/private key pair using the RSA algorithm. The key pair should consist of a public key and a private key.


Add a CLI command that takes a plaintext message and encrypts it using the public key. The command should output the encrypted(cipher) text.


Add a CLI command that takes a ciphertext message and decrypts it using the private key. The command should output the original plaintext message.
